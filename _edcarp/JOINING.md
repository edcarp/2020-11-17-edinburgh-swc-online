# DRAFT EMAIL TO SEND OUT TO ATTENDEES JUST BEFORE THE WORKSHOP.
# See **TODO** lines below for things needing sorted out

Dear all,

You are a registered participant on our Software Carpentry Workshop (17-19 November). The following will help you set up your computer for the workshop and will provide any useful links you may need. There is a lot of information here, so please read everything carefully... **I have marked the section to pay particular attention to with !!!**

## 1. Installing Zoom: !!!
If you don’t have Zoom installed you can do so here: https://zoom.us/download. Please make sure that it is upgraded to Zoom version 5.0 or better.

**TODO Giacomo: Can you fill in the following bit for me???**
**TODO: Do we know whether the UoE Zoom instructions are fine here??**
Joining the workshop, open from 8:50 am on Wednesday  01/07/2020

Best practices using Zoom:
Rename yourself with your full name (→ Click “Participants” tab, find your name and click on the rename button) and share your video, if possible (it is easier to teach when instructors can see people’s faces).
Mute yourself if you are not speaking (mute button in the toolbar at the bottom).
Use Zoom nonverbal feedback indicators (→ Click “Participants” tab to raise hands or give feedback or ask for help). You will get more info on this during the introduction.

## 2. Preparing for the workshop
You will find that having more than one screen will help you follow the course. If you can display the Zoom session on an external monitor and type on your laptop/desktop then you will get the most benefit (use an extended desktop - not mirroring displays). If you have the right connections you could use your TV as an external monitor or if you have a network-enabled tablet you could connect to zoom.using this and do your typing on your laptop. If you have more than one device available you can connect to Zoom on one and use the second one to perform the task. If you only have one display then the optimal configuration will be to use half of your screen for the Zoom window and the other half for your application. You will find that your screen real estate will be precious. Please, be vocal if you are having problems and we shall try to help where we can.

## 3. Installing necessary software !!!
Make sure you have installed the necessary software on your laptop. Details can be found on the workshop page:
https://edcarp.github.io/2020-11-17-edinburgh-swc-online

The key software you'll need is as follows:
* An up to date web browser
* For the Bash (Tuesday) and Git (Thursday) lessons: If you use Windows then you will need to install Git for Windows. Mac and Linux users should suitable software already. Alternatively, if you use the University Compute Cluster (Eddie) or the School of Physics & Astronomy's SSH Login Server, then you can use those instead.
* For the Python (Wednesday) lesson: We'll be using the University's Noteable service, which just requires you to have a browser. But we'd recommend you install Anaconda as well, as it's really useful!

If you have any trouble, send us an email or ask for 

## 4. Testing Zoom and Software Installation
We are running a setup session on Monday 16th November between 14:00 and 15:00 to help you familiarize with the Zoom environment and help with any installation issues. Please if you have some time do connect to make sure everyone will be ready to go on Thursday. (NB the link is different from the workshop one) !!!
