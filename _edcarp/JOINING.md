# DRAFT EMAIL TO SEND OUT TO ATTENDEES JUST BEFORE THE WORKSHOP
# See **TODO** lines below for things needing sorted out

Dear all,

You are a registered participant on our Software Carpentry Workshop (17-19 November). The following will help you set up your computer for the workshop and will provide any useful links you may need. There is a lot of information here, so please read everything carefully... **We have marked things requiring particular attention with !!! below.**

## 1. Installing Zoom !!!
If you don’t have Zoom installed you can do so here: https://zoom.us/download. Please make sure that it is upgraded to Zoom version 5.0 or better.

**TODO Giacomo: Can you fill in the following bit for me???**

**TODO: Do we know whether the UoE Zoom instructions are fine here??**

* Joining the workshop, open from 9:30 am on Tuesday  17/11/2020
* Zoom Meeting Room:  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86443998162?pwd=NmpzbHV6V3ErRWU2M1RkOVcxNy9Pdz09
* Password: 091333

Best practices using Zoom:
* Rename yourself with your full name (→ Click “Participants” tab, find your name and click on the rename button)
* Share your video, if possible (it is easier to teach when instructors can see people’s faces).
* Mute yourself if you are not speaking (mute button in the toolbar at the bottom).
* Use Zoom nonverbal feedback indicators (→ Click “Participants” tab to raise hands or give feedback or ask for help).

You will get more info on this during the introduction.

## 2. Preparing for the workshop
You will find that having more than one screen will help you follow the course. If you can display the Zoom session on an external monitor and type on your laptop/desktop then you will get the most benefit (use an extended desktop - not mirroring displays). If you have the right connections you could use your TV as an external monitor or if you have a network-enabled tablet you could connect to Zoom using this and do your typing on your laptop. If you have more than one device available you can connect to Zoom on one and use the second one to perform the task. If you only have one display then the optimal configuration will be to use half of your screen for the Zoom window and the other half for your application. You will find that your screen real estate will be precious. Please, be vocal if you are having problems and we shall try to help where we can.

## 3. Installing necessary software !!!
Make sure you have installed the necessary software on your laptop. Please see the details and instructions on the workshop page:
https://edcarp.github.io/2020-11-17-edinburgh-swc-online

The key software you'll need is as follows:
* An up to date web browser
* For the Bash (Tuesday) and Git (Thursday) lessons: If you use Windows then you will need to install Git for Windows. Mac and Linux users should have suitable software already. Alternatively, if you use the University Compute Cluster (Eddie) or the School of Physics & Astronomy's SSH Login Server, then you can use these for the lessons instead.
* For the Python (Wednesday) lesson: We'll be using the University's Noteable service, which just requires you to have a browser. But we'd recommend you install Anaconda as well, as it's really useful!

If you have any trouble, send us an email or ask during the setup session (see below).

## 4. Testing Zoom and Software Installation
We are running a setup session on Monday 16th November between 14:00 and 15:00 to help you familiarize with the Zoom environment and help with any installation issues. Please, if you have some time, do connect to make sure everyone will be ready to go on Tuesday. (NB the link is different from the workshop one) !!!

**TODO Giacomo: Can you please check the following for me? Also the previous sentence about the links being different.**

* Zoom URL for Zoom/installation testing (with embedded password): https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87388886105?pwd=M1psUlBLbEJYWDJOUm1veVlZZWZPdz09
* Password: 587590

## 5. Important Material and Links and things to do
* Workshop page: https://edcarp.github.io/2020-11-17-edinburgh-swc-online
* Collaborative document: https://pad.carpentries.org/2020-11-17-edinburgh-swc-online
* If you haven’t filled in the pre-workshop survey please do so here: https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/wi32rS?slug=2020-11-17-edinburgh-swc-online !!!

**TODO: Should we include links to the lesson websites? Or just add them to the workshop page (and probably the etherpad)?**

## 6. Please let us know if you cannot join
We have a waiting list for the workshop and it would be great to give someone else the chance to join.
If you can't attend, please cancel your booking and send us an email so that we can offer your place
to someone else.

Do let us know if you have any questions.

Looking forward to seeing you all virtually, either on Monday for the troubleshooting or Tuesday for the workshop.

Best wishes,
Giacomo and David.
