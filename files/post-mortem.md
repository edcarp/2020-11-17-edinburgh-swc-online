# Post-mortem to 2020-11-17-edinburgh-online #

- Zoom is not ideal, but it's probably the best option available.
- Share a display, instead of a window, so you can switch views.
- Hard for the instructor to switch between the windows.
- David would love to have a Jupyter-like solution for the Shell lesson. The bash kernel for Juypyter is not seen as an option though.
- Shellshare is good but it does not replace entirely the instructor's screen-sharing.
- Mixed feeling about using slides. Slides help to give a context and a narrative but some (esp. Matthew) see them as contrary to the Carpentry orthdoxy (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/).
- Matthew thinks git lesson is broken and it should be delivered in two hours, ideally in a GUI version. Mario is more conservative about the git lesson. Magnus proposes a workshop where the very basics of git are taught in a short lesson between Shell and Python. We will pilot this.
- Helping worked reasonably but the use of Zoom verabl indicators should be enforced more stricktly, with a good interactive session at the start.
- Break-out rooms need to be well understood, set up, tested and employed, before and at the start of the workshop.
- Zoom chat doesn't work well. Replace with Slack (invite link on the etherpad) or indeed Teams.
