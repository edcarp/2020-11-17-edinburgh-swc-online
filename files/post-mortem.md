Good
David: Bailey went really well. Prep is good
Bad: 
David: didn't enjoy delivering Shell. Wish we had jupyter for shell. Consider bahs kernel for Jupyter 
Matthew: didn't like slides. Slides are not part of a Carpentries lesson. 
David: narrative is good though and slides help with there.
Mario: Git lesson is broken. Using GUI would be good but keeping the terminal.
Robert: liked how issues were handled. 
Magnus: felt useless. Too many helpers.

**Delivery**
- Alternatives to share screen?
  - Shell share, but not really a full replacement.
  - Shre display ratehr than only window. Or portion of the screen.

- Content & pace
  - Matthew: 5 hours git are insane. 
  - Magnus: Small git lesson after Shell before Python as an intro. Not conflict resolution. Straight onto using git.
- Manage expectations

**Zoom**
- Breakouts
- Non-verbal indicators
  - stronger demonstration of how it works
- Chat
- Slack
-Teams


**Helping**
- What works?
  - 
- What doesn't work?
