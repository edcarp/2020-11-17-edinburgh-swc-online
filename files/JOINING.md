# EMAIL SENT OUT TO ATTENDEES ON FRIDAY 13th NOVEMBER

Hi,

You are a registered participant on our Software Carpentry Workshop next week (17-19 November). This email lists the key things you’ll need for joining the workshop and will help you set up your computer for it. There is a lot of information here, so please read everything carefully!  

**We have marked things requiring particular attention with (!!!) below.**

Please also note that all times advertised here are UK time, currently GMT.

## 1. Installing Zoom (!!!)

The workshop will use the Zoom video-conferencing system.

You may have already installed Zoom for your University work. If you haven't yet installed Zoom, please install it from: https://zoom.us/download. Please make sure that you have Zoom version 5.0 or better.

## 2. Joining details for the workshop

You’ll be able to join the workshop from 9:30am on Tuesday 17th November.

## 3. Installing necessary software (!!!)

You’ll maybe need to install some software for the workshop. Please make sure you do this before the workshop starts. Full details and instructions are on the workshop page: 
https://edcarp.github.io/2020-11-17-edinburgh-swc-online

Here’s a quick summary of the key things you’ll need:
* An up-to-date web browser.
* For the Bash (Tuesday) and Git (Thursday) lessons: If you use Windows then you will need to install Git for Windows. Mac and Linux users should have suitable software already. Alternatively, if you use the University Compute Cluster (Eddie) or the School of Physics & Astronomy's SSH Login Server, then you can either of use these for the lessons instead.
* For the Python (Wednesday) lesson: We'll be using the University's Noteable service, which just requires you to have a browser. But we'd recommend you install Anaconda as well, as it's really useful!

If you're a Mac user, we recommend you hold off upgrading to macOS 11.0 (just released today!) until after the workshop.

If you have any trouble, send us an email or ask during the setup session (see below). We’ll also be available in the Zoom meeting from 9:30am on Tuesday, should you have any last-minute software issues.

## 4. Testing Zoom and Software Installation

We are running a setup session between 2-3pm on Monday 16th November to help you familiarise with the Zoom environment and help with any software installation issues. If you have time, please do join the session to help make sure you’re all ready to go on Tuesday morning.

Here are the joining details for the setup session:

**NB:** This Zoom link is different from the workshop one!

## 5. Preparing for the workshop

You will find that having more than one screen will help you follow the course. If you can display the Zoom session on an external monitor and type on your laptop/desktop then you will get the most benefit (use an extended desktop - not mirrored displays). If you have the right connections you could use your TV as an external monitor or if you have a network-enabled tablet you could connect to Zoom using this and do your typing on your laptop. If you have more than one device available you can connect to Zoom on one and use the second one to perform the task. If you only have one display then the optimal configuration will be to use half of your screen for the Zoom window and the other half for your application. You will find that your screen real estate will be precious. Please, be vocal if you are having problems and we shall try to help where we can.

## 6. Best practices using Zoom

* Rename yourself with your full name (→ Click “Participants” tab, find your name and click on the rename button)
* Share your video, if possible (it is easier to teach when instructors can see people’s faces).
* Mute yourself when you are not speaking (mute button in the toolbar at the bottom).
* Use Zoom nonverbal feedback indicators (→ Click “Participants” tab to raise hands or give feedback or ask for help).

You will get more info on this during the introduction.

## 8. Please let us know if you cannot join

We have a waiting list for the workshop and it would be great to give someone else the chance to join. If you can't attend, please cancel your booking and send us an email so that we can offer your place to someone else.


We’re looking forward to seeing you all virtually, either on Monday for the setup session or Tuesday for the workshop!

Do let us know if you have any questions.

Best wishes, 
Giacomo and David
